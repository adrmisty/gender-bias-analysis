# gender-bias-analysis
Repository for my CS4864 Machine Learning topic review on gender bias and ways to mitigate it in Natural Language Processing (with a special focus on directly debiasing word embeddings).

- Datasets used: Google News (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leadbest/googlenewsvectorsnegative300) and COCA (for CDA implementation: https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/).

All references found in my report.
